            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <P><span class="firstwd">I </span>was not fond of IT up until the middle of my secondary study. At first, I was a guy
                who is interested in natural science and I did a decent job with it. Then one day, one of my friends – who was and still
                a computer hardware enthusiast, come to me and shared his understandings and excitements in computers, probably because he 
                had no one else to talk about the topic. I was motivated by him and his passion, so I started paying attention to computer 
                and was driven by it since then. Nowadays I am attending <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/" target="blank">UTS</a> in <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/future-students/find-a-course/bachelor-science-information-technology" target="blank">
                Bachelor of Sciencein Information Technology</a> and be a member of UTS family, and possibly because the word “science” in 
                the bachelor name seemed appealing to me.</P>
                    <br> <br>
            
            <h3>My experience with IT</h3>
                <p><span class="firstwd">W</span>hen I was driven by my friend’s passion in computers, I did not know where to start learning
                about them. That was when my family’s old laptop fell into my sight – the <a href="https://www.sony-asia.com/electronics/support/laptop-pc-vpc-series/vpcea45fg/specifications" target="blank">VAIO</a> 
                from 2010. While it was still functioning fine by the time I am start investing in IT, it contained tons of errors, one after 
                another (system errors, default application errors, programs not responding, etc.). However, I gradually built up my skills and 
                learned a lot by continuously fixing it.</p>
                <p><span class="firstwd">B</span>y constantly trying to fix the laptop, my skill had gradually improved overtime. Now I am an 
                expert in solving IT-related problems, in my family, “specialize” in fixing and troubleshooting hardware and operation system. 
                From installing basic and crucial software and computer functions required for my parent’s jobs to managing and configuring my 
                home’s network router so that no one in my neighborhood will have access to my network for free.</p>
                <p><span class="firstwd">S</span>ince I am an international student, I neither have any experience regarding HSC nor working 
                experiences in computing, even back then when I am still in my home country. I also have zero knowledge about programming before 
                taking a degree in Australia. But I am willing to learn and to open up to meet new people, even if I was a little bit behind in 
                term of computer skills and English skills.</p>
                    <br> <br>

            <h3>My hobbies</h3>   
                <p><span class="firstwd">I</span>n relation to IT, I want to create my own network system and home server to manage a huge 
                amount of data that I am and will obtain in the future. This activity includes NAS (network-attached storage) server and network 
                hardwares alongside with secure network configuration to provide the most suitable service to me. These services including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Media content</li>
                    <li>Computer backup</li>
                    <li>SmartHome applications</li>
                    <li>Virtual assistant</li>
                    <li>Opportunity for me to learn and discover new things</li>
                </ul>
                    <br>
                <p>The only thing that is holding me back to start developing my system is my empty wallet.</p>
