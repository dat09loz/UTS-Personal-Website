            <h3>Technical</h3>
            <P><span class="firstwd">T</span>he first page of my website is the index.html under the ‘websystems’ directory. 
            This page has a nice dark grey navigation bar/flexbox which is located on the left side of the webpage. The bar 
            contains the following links to the other pages including: past.html, future.html, comments.html and an icon which 
            contains a link to index.html page – the website’s homepage. A flexbox is a good idea in order to organise the 
            content to properly positioned while the browser is being resized by the user – a great solution to access the 
            website using small screen devices. The navigation buttons will turn into a darker grey when you hover your mouse 
            near it, and will turn red if you are on the page that you are currently on (“The Past” tab on the navigation bar 
            will stay red when you are on “The Past” page).</P>
            <P><span class="firstwd">I</span>n the homepage, you will see a brief information about myself including my full 
            name and my current degree at UTS, as well as the release date of the website and website’s certification. I want 
            the homepage to be seen without scrolling for the viewers to know about my details in a glance. </P>
            <P><span class="firstwd">T</span>he one that is the most impressive about this website to me is not about the 
            aesthetics, accessibility or usability of the website, but the fact that I can manage to put every bits of the 
            website together without any HTML and CSS beforehand, or any programming knowledge whatsoever. I mostly use ‘.class’ 
            and ‘#id’ selector because they are easy to use and organise in my opinion. I used class selector to separate each 
            part in the website: navigation bar, main heading, sub-heading, paragraph, etc. And ‘#id’ selector to point out modify 
            the specific component in the class. Naming the classes, ids and try to locate and add some spices to them when writing 
            the CSS file for me was very difficult but it is worth it.</P>
            <P><span class="firstwd">A</span>t first I want to make the navigation bar up to the very top of the webpage, but somehow 
            it did not sit on a single row no matter how I set it up (make a new class, add another CSS line, etc.) so I ended up 
            with a vertical chunk of navigation buttons. But it looked better than I expected, so I designed the rest of the web 
            around it. Added border to my text using ’border’ and aligned it using ‘margin’ to make it look better than just a 
            plain piece of paragraphs on a dark background. Finally, I used ‘span’ to add color and resized the first letter of 
            every paragraph. I guessed it looks cool. To make the webpage more interesting to look at, I added a simple icon 
            on the bottom left, since the assignment require at least 1 image appear on the page.</P>
                <br> <br>

            <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
            <p><span class="firstwd">I </span>stick with the black and red theme on my website. The reason why I add the icon 
            that you can see on the bottom right of the page and the icon on the page’s tab in the browser (for example the 
            play button when you go to Youtube) is that it is from the game that I like. I have been influenced by the mobile 
            rhythms game call <a href="https://www.rayark.com/en/games/cytus2/" target="blank">Cytus II</a>, the icon and the black-and-red 
            aesthetic taken from <a href="https://cytus.fandom.com/wiki/Ivy" target="blank">Ivy</a> – one character from the game. The background 
            that I choose also comes from the game, specifically a blurred image of the character’s personal OS.</p>
            <p><span class="firstwd">T</span>his website was aimed to user that see my page as personal since I do not use any 
            advance techniques and skills when developing my site. The ‘view-port’ meta allows the website to be readable across 
            multiple screen sizes. While I only use black (dark grey to be precise) and red for my webpage, it does no t hard 
            to read at all due to the text color being white. I put all the webpage’s content beside the navigation bar into a 
            translucent panel with red border. This method makes the page feel like it has more depth in it without being too 
            difficult to operate and use the website.</p>
            <p><span class="firstwd">I </span>keep the theme consistence across all pages: past, future and comments to make 
            them look like they come from one source, which is very important, while making them easier to decorate since they 
            used exactly the same style.</p>
            <p><span class="firstwd">I </span>would like to add animation to the background to make it feels like you have 
            accessed the system, but the assignment does not allow it so meh.</p>
